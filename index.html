              We can only assume that people are lazy might be because they lack
              <strong>self-esteem</strong> because they always think that
              they'll fail, lack <strong>discipline</strong> since they don't
              really try to make a difference, lack of
              <strong>positive recognition</strong> whenever they do make a
              change or lack of <strong>interest</strong> on certain things
              because they bore them or don't really care what happens.
            </p>

            <p>
              There is a slim chance that people who are lazy are born
              ridiculously rich that they don't need to do anything besides
              fooling around with a lot of money.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other people may also be the one to blame for their laziness.
              Possibly because someone are doing all their chores for them
              stealing their growth potential thus making them reliant on ohers.

                <h4>Decline in Productivity</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Productivity would be the most affected by laziness, when a
                    person is not motivated to make an action, it would be
                    difficult and time consuming to finish a task.

                <h4>Missed Opportunities</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If a person is lazy, he/she would most likely miss an
                    opportunity whether it is personal or professional. You
                    would certainly not have a love life if you wouldn't make an
                    effort and try to ask someone out or atleast talk to them.
                    Achieving your dreams is out of the picture without pursuing
                    it.

                  <li>
                    If you are lazy like the creator of this blog, then you'll
                    find yourself not in the best shape and health of your life.
                    Unless it is caused by an illness or disability then it's
                    not counted as laziness.

                <h4>Damaged Relationships</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Laziness can put a strain on your relationship with your
                    family, friends and partner. Failing to provide your
                    commitment and responsibility on the relationship will make
                    you seen as unreliable and undesirable.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Consistent failure to do something will destroy your
                    self-confidence. You'll start to doubt yourself, question
                    your worth and procrastinate your every move.

                By practicing self-care, you can prevent the lack of
                self-esteem. Taking care of your Physical and Mental health will
                boost your lifestyle that will drastically change you
                self-esteem for good. By doing so will boost your mood and
                increase confidence thus making you motivated to make a change.

              <li>
                By setting your goals and making a structured routine, you can
                change your lack of discipline. It would be hard to work if you
                don't know what needs work, what you need to do is create a goal
                and breaking it down to smaller and more manageable tasks will
                make it easier to do. Now combine that with utilizaiton of your
                time by establishing schedules and creating a routine from it
                will make a huge difference on your productivity.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Surround yourself with supportive and understanding people to
                combat lack of positive recognition. unappreciated efforts and
                accomplishments are the biggest culprits of molding hard-working
                / industrious people to laziness. To prevent this, surround
                yourself with people who have the same mind and goal as you.
                Always remember that you don't need to change yourself just to
                fit in, there are billions of people on earth so just be
                yourself and you'll find your group anytime soon.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Find your motivation so that you won't lack interest on anything
                anymore. Being motivated is a powerful drug that cures laziness.
                Making yourself motivated by visualizing the satisfaction of
                accomplishment by doing that action truly makes someone indus
